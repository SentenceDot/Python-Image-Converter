## Getting Started

## How to Contribute

### This is our contribution workflow

1. Find an issue to work on, or propose a new feature by creating a new issue.
2. Discuss the issue with the maintainers to ensure it’s a good fit for the project.
3. Work on the issue in your forked repository.
4. Submit a pull request once your changes are ready.

### Best practices
To ensure the best possible experience for both contributors and users:
- Remember to limit each PR to the scope of the specific issue you worked on.
- DO NOT include dependencies, features or change the default code behaviour without discussing it beforehand.
- Each PR should be ATOMIC and should be conducted only as part of the contribution workflow, otherwise it will not be accepted.
